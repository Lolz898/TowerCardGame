# TowerCardGame

A personal passion project in Unity, combining my two favourite genres, roguelike card games and tower defence.

Currently very WIP, featuring basic AI for pathfinding and attacks but with major improvements from past projects.

A start at a card interface with working decks for draw and discard piles and a hand.
- Cards are initialised from a base asset and populated with art and stats.

Current Goals: 
- Rework hand sorting to use custom sort instead of Unity default
- Start a basic tower AI with different firing types
- Buff/Debuff system that can target tags
